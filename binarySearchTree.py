A binary tree is a linked data structure where each nodes points to at most 2 child nodes.
Nodes with no children are leaf nodes.

The depth of a node is the number of nodes from root to the node, with root having depth
of 0.
The height of a node is the number of nodes on the path from the node to the deepest leaf.
Count from the node and up towards the root.
Height of the tree is the maximum height of any node in the tree.

Binary Search Tree is a binary tree to help search data in the tree where the nodes greater
than the root is on the right and nodes less than the rot is on the right.
