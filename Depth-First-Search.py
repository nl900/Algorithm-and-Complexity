Traversal on graph or tree structures.

Time complexity is O(V+E) on a graph when represented as an adjacency list (higher if using a list), 
V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
On a tree, it's O(V).
A tree is a subset of graphs has N nodes and (N-1) edges and all nodes must be reachable from the 
root and exactly one possible path from the root to the node.
Graphs have no rules its connections and may contain any set of edges that can connect nodes in any way.
