"""
Divide and conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that breaks a problem into subproblems and recursively solves the subproblems 
and then finally combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem. Since they're solved recursively,
each subproblem must be smaller than the original problem and there must be a base case for subproblems.

Merge sort employ divide and conquer based on recursion with running time of O(nlogn).
